# Image-Classification
An image classification project using neural networks to classify images into predefined categories based on visual input.

This project focuses on image classification using neural networks. The model is trained on a dataset of labeled images, learning to classify them into predefined categories. The neural network processes the visual input, extracts important features, and makes predictions about the image's class. The project showcases the power of deep learning in handling complex visual data, with potential applications in fields like computer vision, object detection, and automated image analysis. The model's performance is evaluated based on accuracy and other relevant metrics.
